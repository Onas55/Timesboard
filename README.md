This is a multiplication times table that calculates from 1-100'
Created a nested loop that consists of a inner and outer loop. 
-outer loop: iterates through the number from 1-100(represented by variable w) 
-inner loop: iterates through the number from 1-10(represented by variable i),
this loop multiplies the current number(w) by the iterator to produce the multiplication answer

Declared a multiplication variable to calculate the product of w and i.

Output The output would consist of all multiplication table from 1 - 100 , the code is reusable you can also change the conditions.
